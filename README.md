## Motivation

KeyPaths are provided by default by swift, but they can't be extended, you can't create them manually and they have several limitations. While KeyPaths work for structs, [swift-casepaths](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths "GitHub - pointfreeco/swift-case-paths: ðŸ§° Case paths bring the power and ergonomics of key paths to enums!") library (CasePath) provides an interface for enums. However, you can't combine a KeyPath and a CasePath, and there are things that can't be done by either.
