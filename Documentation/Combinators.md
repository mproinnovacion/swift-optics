# Combinators

There are two main types of combinators: vertical and horizontal.

## Vertical Combinators

In these combinators, the Part of an optic is the Whole of the next one, thus allowing to traverse deeper into the structure.

## Horizontal Combinators

In these combinators, all Wholes and Parts are the same, so we get a final optic with the Whole and a combination of the Parts of all the inner optics.
